The tracking and management of employee work hours and projects is made easier by the integration of Toggl time sheets with HRMS. Employees can easily import their time sheet data, including hours worked on specific tasks or projects, directly into the HRMS by connecting Toggl, a time tracking tool, with HRMS. 

**Steps to view the team’s toggl sheet** 

- Log in to HRMS and go to the Toggl Track module. 

- Click on Team Toggl Sheet to view team timesheets. 

- Use Week Start and Week End to move between different weeks. 

- Click Current Week to return to the ongoing week. 

- Use the Select Employee dropdown to choose an employee. 

- The employee’s timesheet details (Date, Project, Description, Hours) are displayed in the table, with Total Hours shown at the bottom.

    - **Submitted** – list of employees who have submitted their timesheets. 

    - **Not Submitted** – list of employees who have not submitted their timesheets. 

- Select Summary Report to generate a consolidated report for the selected week/employee. 

- Click Reset to clear selections and reapply filters. 

- At the bottom right corner, a graph of work entries is displayed.
