- Once submitted, the Reporting Person (RP) is notified via an email titled On Duty Approval. 

- The HRMS also displays an indication on the Notification icon, showing On Duty Approval requests. 

- Login into HRMS and Navigate to Attendance and select Team Attendance Requests. 

- Verify the employee’s name, selected WFH dates, and reason provided. 

- Approve – if the request is valid.
