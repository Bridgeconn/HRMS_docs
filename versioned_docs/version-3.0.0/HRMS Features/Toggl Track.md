The tracking and management of employee work hours and projects is made easier by the integration of Toggl time sheets with HRMS. Employees can easily import their time sheet data, including hours worked on specific tasks or projects, directly into the HRMS by connecting Toggl, a time tracking tool, with HRMS. 

Work logs are recorded in the Toggl time sheet. [toggl track](https://toggl.com/)
