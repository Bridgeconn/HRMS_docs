**Announcements and Achievements** 

Announcements and Achievements in HRMS serve as a centralized reference point for company news, updates, and employee achievements. Keeping employees informed and engaged is easy by posting announcements about events, policy changes, and organizational milestones. 

**Policies** 

Company policies serve as a guide for employees, outlining the rules, expectations and practices at work. HRMS enables the sharing of policy updates and ensures employees are aware of revisions and changes. 

To access the policies, go to the Company tab and select Policies. Then, choose the policy you wish to view and click the View Policy button.
